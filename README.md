# ProjectEuler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) consists of computational problems that combine various disciplines of mathematics with programming and intuitive problem solving, meant as exercises and ways to push one's skills in these domains. 

The first 100 problems are of a simpler difficulty, and are permitted to be shared per the website's terms and conditions, under the condition that any discussion and sharing is done in an informative manner/in such a way to instruct methods. With that said, this repository contains my solutions with the intent to describe my approach at solving specific problems as well as provoke discussion with peers who believe there are better ways to solve these problems. I do not believe that any of my solutions are the most efficient, and thus would love to hear thoughts that people have to share on my approach.

## What's the purpose?
I decided to work through Project Euler such that I can keep my problem solving skills refined in a broad manner whislt also ensuring that my scripting skills stay relevant. My current coursework has me working with lower level languages and theoretical concepts such that I don't often find myself working with Python, MATLAB, or similar tools.

I am making it a goal to solve 2 problems a week, up until I complete the first 100.
